Git for Gits Presentation

This is a intro presentation on Git for some of my peers at Uni. Feel free to fork for your own uses, or raise an issue or PR if you think it could use improvement. It's designed to get people started on Git and arm them with the tools I believe they'd actually use on a daily basis, so more complicated commands are left out.
